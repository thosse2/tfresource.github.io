## ADB45 Special Committee for Travel Forecasting Resources

TRB Special Committee for Travel Forecasting Resources (ADB45) [members](https://www.mytrb.org/CommitteeDetails.aspx?CMTID=3709) are responsible for the technical content of this wiki. Committee members are expected to actively contribute to one or more areas under ADB45’s charge and document their contributions within the tresource.org wiki environment. The contributions of committee Friends are greatly appreciated.

The most important committee's tasks include:

- Manage wiki content on [tfresource.org](http://tfresource.org)
- Organize, promote, and document TRB’s biennial [ITM Conference](http://itmconference.com/)

### Wiki Review Tasks

After the wiki was transferred to Github in Markdown language, every page needs to be reviewed manually. Some pages are good as they are. In some, the automated translations to Markdown language messed up format or content. Often, only small editorial revisions are necessary. In other cases, major surgery is necessary to bring the page back to the old content.

The original layout can be found on the [TFResource Website](http://tfresource.org/Travel_Forecasting_Resource). Please compare the layout of the new website at [https://tfresource.github.io/](https://tfresource.github.io/) with the previous layout at [http://tfresource.org/](http://tfresource.org/) and correct missing figures, messed up tables, formatting issues, etc. Simple instructions for editing can be found [here](https://tfresource.github.io/topics/Contributing.html), and more advanced instructions are provided [here](https://tfresource.github.io/topics/Contributing-Dev-Instructions.html). You are also welcome to update or embellish the content of pages you review at the same time!

Below is a list of all pages that belong to this wiki. If the link to the page is broken, you can find the page by typing the page title into the search field at the top. Once you completed your review, please do the following steps:
1. Remove the tag "- Needs Review" under the Category section at the top of the page you have reviewed
2. Mark the page as reviewed in the table below
3. Mark any issues you encountered (such as "still messed up because I didn't know how to fix it", "The content of this page needs to be updated", ...)
